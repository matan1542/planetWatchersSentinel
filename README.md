# Planet Watchers - By Matan Lasry

## Technologies used:

- React
- Recoil
- SCSS


## Project description:

This project is a one page app made for Planet Watchers.
At this task I've requested to use [Sentinel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/)'s API.
The API should provide an image (I've asked to use two images at same time) of Israel with max cloud coverage rate of 30% as default.

Also, I've had to implement two buttons:

- Replace: change the two displaying images with new ones.
- Brighten: decrease 10% from the two images's max cloud coverage.

## How to run:

1. npm i
2. npm start
